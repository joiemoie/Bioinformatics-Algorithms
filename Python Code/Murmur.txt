Murmur.

Zsa zsa slapped a cop
who pulled her over in La-La land.
She left a booboo on his face
From all the bling-bling on her hand.

Dance the cha cha
Or the can can
Shake your pom pom
To Duran Duran

Bora Bora is an island
Walla Walla's in the US.
The UN's Boutros Boutros-Ghali
used to live near the Suez.

When you say night-night to your baby
there's a fifty-fifty chance
That she may have gone wee-wee
Or made a doo-doo in her pants.

Mahi Mahi is a fish.
Add some tartar, it wouldn't hurt.
Couscous makes a great side dish.
Have a bonbon for dessert.

Lulu wore a muumuu
cocoa-colored like her friend's.
Fifi said it's too matchy-matchy
But they're buddy-buddy 'til the end.

The Mamas and the Papas
Made “Monday Monday” a #1 hit.
Hindsight being 20/20,
Maybe the band shouldn't have quit.

Mork said "Nanu Nanu."
Luke rode on a taun-taun's back.
Ralphie wants a BB gun,
and Mimi's makeup's out of whack.

"Knock knock" began the joke.
Lulu asked, "Who's there?"
But the rim-shot came too early
on the tom tom and the snare.

Sirhan Sirhan shot RFK
It was a dum-dum move, that dork.
They would have sent him to Sing-sing
If he had done it near New York, New York.

"Ha ha" said Jerry Seinfeld
watching the "Yadda yadda" show.
Tsk tsk! Laughing at your own show's jokes
is a TV writer no-no.

The dada artist drew a yo-yo
Being played with by a tsetse fly
Who was standing on a putt-putt course.
Nobody understood why.

The dodo birds have gone extinct.
Tut tut, there are no more living.
"Gobble gobble" says the turkey.
"Have a vegetarian din-din this Thanksgiving."

Peter Pan was a goody goody
who lived in Never Never Land.
But now he's on the wah-wah pedal
playing in a hard rock band.

It's the same old same old with these rhymes.
And so it's almost time to say bye-bye.
I'm running out of things to write. Um...
A sailor says "Aye aye."

Dance the cha cha
Or the can can
Shake your pom pom
To Duran Duran

Choo choo goes the train.
Vroom-vroom goes the Corvette.
Oh no, this is my worst rhyme of all.
Now they'll never link to me from boingboing.net.
